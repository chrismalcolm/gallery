# gallery
A web application for uploading and viewing photos

## WIP
Currently we have the basic web page layout set up. The frames and photos appear in a grid with 3 columns.

## TODO
* Crop whitespace out of frame images
* Load photos from a database
* Fit the page horizontally

## Usage

To run the server, cd into the folder an run:
```bash
~$ python3 server.py
```

Webpage will appear on `localhost:8080`. Press Ctrl + Shift + R to refresh the page.
